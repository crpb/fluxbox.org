# Welcome to fluxbox.org - Home of the Fluxbox windowmanager.

## What is it?

Fluxbox is a windowmanager for X that was based on the
[Blackbox 0.61.1](https://github.com/bbidulock/blackboxwm) code. It is very light on
resources and easy to handle but yet full of features to make an easy, and
extremely fast, desktop experience. It is built using C++ and licensed under the
MIT-License.

## What can it do?

Fluxbox is supplied with lots of native options such as tabbing, grouping, a
long list of keycommands, chainable Keygrabber, fully editable menu and much,
much more. You might want to dive into it and learn more about fluxbox's
features.

## What should I do?

The main-support including a FAQ and many tips was outsourced to the
fluxbox-wiki, which should be the first site to visit if you face problems
setting up fluxbox correctly.

## What can it look like?

To get an impression of what many fluxbox desktops look like and what those
applications are you can see, check out the [screenshots-page]({{< ref "/screenshots/" >}}).
Although fluxbox is "only" a windowmanager, there are typical applications that are frequently
used amongst fluxbox users.

## How can I help?

The best way to get in contact with the development team is to join the
official [irc-channel]() and speak directly to them or to use the bug-tracker and
forums at [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fluxbox/).
