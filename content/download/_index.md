## PRE-BUILD BINARY PACKAGES

Many distributions have included Fluxbox in their package-manager. Those
Packages are maintained by their creators. To get more information about
available binaries check the wiki-site that is dedicated to that issue.

It is a wiki, so if you are interested to support Fluxbox as a
package-maintainer please feel free to add your name to that site.

In any case, please note that Fluxbox development team are not responsible for
any package included in your distribution.

## GIT DEVELOPMENT VERSION

The latest Fluxbox development-version is available from our new
git-repository. It sometimes might crash or perhaps does not work properly
(the build is in a state of 'flux'), hence why it is called "development
version" - it is usually stable, though, as any show stoppers are quickly
found and rectified.

Instructions that explain how to use git and build Fluxbox from the sources
are in our precious wiki
