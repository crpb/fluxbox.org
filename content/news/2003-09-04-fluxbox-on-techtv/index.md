# Fluxbox on TechTV!

<i>Today Murray Stokely, the Chief Release Engineer for FreeBSD, and myself
did a FreeBSD vs. Linux 'shootout' on the technology network TechTV,
on their most popular show, The Screen Savers.
<br><br>

The linux guys installed a typical KDE desktop but we wanted something
that looked a bit cooler and since I've been a Fluxbox user for
sometime, we demo'd Fluxbox as our windowmanager.
<br><br>

It was a HUGE hit and I've already gotten a ton of emails regarding
Fluxbox. Hopefully, you saw a spike in your website traffic today.
<br><br>

It will re-air on TechTV Wednesday, September 3rd, at 9am PST.
I don't have a digital copy of the clip (yet!) but will probably have
one on our website soon.</i>

Is it cool or what? :) Check the <a href="http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/linux/story/0,24330,3511343,00.html">TechTV website</a>. Thx <a href="mailto:klausman-fluxbox&#64;tuts.net">Tobias</a> for forwarding the email.
