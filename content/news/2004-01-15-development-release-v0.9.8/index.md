# Development release v0.9.8!

A new development release is available. This is primarily due to a fix
for a nasty memory leak in 0.9.7 (uses up lots of X memory).
A new feature is the transparent toolbar, along with a number of other
bugfixes.
Check it out  <a href="http://www.fluxbox.org/version-0.9.php">here</a>.
