# Fluxconf2015 - Genesis of the 'There is no cabal!'


Much to the surprise of MOST (I think, ALL except two) fluxboxers on the
planet, a HUGE conference took place on 2015-08-13 in Heidelberg:

**Fluxconf2015!**

In case you missed the conference or were too late to grab the gold
tickets: You next chance will be in 2025, Fluxconf takes place only once 
in 10 years. If the moon is at the right position.

Right now, in Heidelberg / Germany, <a href="">DebConf2015</a> is taking 
place. A nice dude, who travels under the name "Paul â˜ƒ Tagliamonte", 
happens to be there, for some 
<a href="https://portfolio.debian.net/result?email=paultag%40debian.org">absolutely</a> 
<a href="https://pault.ag/">unrelated</a>
<a href="http://opensource.org/docs/board-annotated#PaulTagliamonte">reason</a>.

Coincidentally, yours truly had things to do in Bonn / Germany, which is
relativly close to DebConf2015. So, in some kind of spontaneous mood, we
decided to just meet in person in Heidelberg.

Time was crucial and very limited. We managed to pack a lot of things into
the little we had: a keynote, several talks, a BoF regarding version 
numbers, evil master plans and a lot  more. And 
<a href="https://twitter.com/paultag/status/631854563243524096">beer</a>.
Obviously.

Sadly, we were too drunk and/or jetlagged (Paul was up 24hours already when
I arrived at his location) to take any pictures. So, you have to take my
word for it: it was great!
