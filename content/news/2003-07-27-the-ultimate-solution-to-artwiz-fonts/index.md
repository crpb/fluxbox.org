# The ultimate solution to artwiz fonts!

I love artwiz fonts, and I was really disapointed I couldn't use them with gtk2/kde3 apps anymore.
What did I do? Fixed them! :) Here you have <a href="/artwiz-aleczapka/artwiz-aleczapka.jpg">screenshot</a> running gnome-font-selector, Nautilus, MozillaFirebird and kcontrol with artwiz fonts displayed properly.<br>
Read <a href="/artwiz-aleczapka/README">how to install</a> and <a href="/artwiz-aleczapka/artwiz-aleczapka.tar.bz2">get fixed artwiz fonts here</a>. Of cause they still work with Fluxbox (even when you have antialiasing on).
