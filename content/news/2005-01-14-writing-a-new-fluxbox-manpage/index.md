# Writing a new fluxbox - manpage

<p>Hello folks, </p>
<p> as many of you know (or not): The current manpage of fluxbox is a bit
behind whats currently inside fluxbox and thus, it needs a
facelifting, refreshing and shiny new colors. Curt Micol, widely known
as Asenchi, has started a tiny subproject, called "newfluxman":
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asenchi.com/misc/newfluxman.txt">http://www.asenchi.com/misc/newfluxman.txt</a>
<br><br>
Thats actually what he has written so far. We (the fluxboxteam) would
like to encourage anyone of you, who is interested in contributing to
that new manpage, to write ideas, thoughts, sections and whatnot to
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;asenchi [ta] asenchi [tod] com&gt;
<br>
</p>
Cheers and happy fluxboxing!
