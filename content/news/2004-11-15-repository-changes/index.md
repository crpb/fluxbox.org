# Repository Changes

Hi Folks,

At the moment we are moving the our cvs-repository from sourceforge.net to
a subversion based repository at <a
    href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/fluxbox/">berlios.de</a>.  We are doing this for
serveral reasons:

<ul>
    <li>subversion is a pretty nice cvs-replacement with several
    advantages</li>
    <li>recurring problems with the cvs-repository hosted on sf.net
        <ul>
            <li>speed</li>
            <li>anonymous cvs is hours behind developer cvs</li>
            <li>reliability</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

The fluxbox.org site will remain hosted at sf.net along with the
bugtracker, only the cvs-repository will be moving.

For those that may be afraid of learning yet another tool, we believe you
will find <a href="subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> to be similar to cvs in usage considering the interface,
but faster and friendlier as a whole.

Thank you for your patience in this move.
