# Artwiz Fonts and locale settings - the solution

I think all of you know very well done fonts made by artwiz. Especially they look great with Fluxbox, the only problem was when somebody wanted to use some different encoding (locale settings) then C or POSIX they didn't show up.<br>
We had some way to fix it but it was just a 'patch'. Sometime ago I was able to solve this problem pernamently and in a proper way.
You can read more on updated <a href="/docs/en/artwiz-fonts.php#localefix">Artwiz-fonts HOWTO</a>.<br>
Note: This will help you to fix this issue not just with Fluxbox but with other applications as well (eg. evolution and UTF-8).
