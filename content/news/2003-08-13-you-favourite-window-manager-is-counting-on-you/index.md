# You favourite window manager is counting on you!

<a href="mailto:klausman&#64;schwarzvogel.de">Tobias Klausmann</a> wrote a letter on our mailing-list today:<br>
<i>"As some of you know, I'm the documentation maintainer of Fluxbox. This
includes the DocBook XML (or SGML) found on the official site in its
English version and a teeny bit of authorship on the man page.
<br><br>

Unfortunately, my day job has been silently taking larger and larger
chunks of my time. This has reached the point where I'm unable to deal
with the documentation in an appropriate way. For the last few weeks I
tried to get coordination of the international docs, the new docs for
the 0.9.x (and 1.x) series and a new facility for an online FAQ at least
marginally done, but failed at doing so.
<br><br>

While I really enjoyed working with the whole fluxbox team, both the
devel guys and the regulars of #fluxbox on Freenode, I feel that it's
better if I hand off the doc-hat to someone else. If any of the people
here are willing to step in, <a href="mailto:klausman&#64;schwarzvogel.de">mail me</a> or <a href="mailto:fluxgen&#64;users.sourceforge.net">Henrik (fluxgen)</a> off-list and we'll see how I can get you up to speed.
<br><br>

I will stay with you (you don't get rid of me, apologies ;)) on IRC and
here on the mailinglists and I will donate bits and pieces of time.
<br><br>

Keep on rockin',<br>
Tobias"</i>

Thanks Tobias for the great work he done on fluxbox documentation!
