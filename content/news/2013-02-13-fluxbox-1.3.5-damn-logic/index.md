# Fluxbox 1.3.5 - Damn logic!


A nasty, little bug went undiscovered into 1.3.3 and prevented the logic
commands from working. So, if you happen to use any of the logic commands
like 'if', 'and' or .. well .. 'or' in your keys-file: This is the release
that fixes that for you. Nothing else was added or fixed.

Sorry for the inconvinience!
