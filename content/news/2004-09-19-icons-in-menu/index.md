# Icons in menu?

<a href="mailto:mark@brier.me.uk">Mark Brier</a> asks on fluxbox-users mailing list:
<I>
I'm using fluxbox-0.9.10-r2 and boy does it look good! What I'd like to
know, is how to use icons in the menu. It would seem that you create
~/.fluxbox/icons and put .xpm icons into that folder named aterm.xpm,
xmms.xpm etc.
<br><br>

This doesn't work out-of-the-box, and someone on forums.gentoo.org
mentioned that the icon needs to be referenced in the menu file.
<br><br>

Does anyone know the syntax for this?
