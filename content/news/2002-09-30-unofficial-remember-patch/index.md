Xavier Brouckaert made some time ago a <a href="/download/patches/unofficial-fluxbox-0.1.12-remember-patch.bz2">patch</a> which enabled Fluxbox (v0.1.10) to remember and restore
application settings like position, size, workspace, decorations, tab style... and so on.<br>
This patch was also available for v0.1.11 and because of <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/fluxbox-users">users requst</a>,
it is now available also for the latest v0.1.12 release.<br>
This patch adds 2 features:
<blockquote>
    1) Ability to launch applications at fluxbox startup via a submenu called 'Startup' in the menu file. It's useful for those using gdm as login manager (without .xsession).
    <br><br>

    2) Remembering of workspace, dimensions, position and other parameters via a new submenu called 'Remember...' when you right click on the titlebar of a window. Window settings are saved in a new file "~/.fluxbox/apps".
</blockquote>
Read the instruction and grab it on the <a href="/download.php#patches">download page</a>.
<br>
<b>NOTICE:</b> Do not disable tabs in Fluxbox configuration, cause you will get lots of crushes when you try to move tabs around.
You can still disable tabs for given applications and do not notice crushes when you have tabs enabled in Fluxbox.
