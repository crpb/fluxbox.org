# Fluxbox 1000 days old!

Just 2 days ago was 1000 days since Henrik first registered fluxbox as a
project on sourceforge. Cast your mind ("or browser":http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=52557) 
back to those early days when bbkeys was first integrated.

Haven't we "come a long way.":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35398&package_id=27561
Well done Henrik, and all involved in its evolution along the way! We look forward
to version 1.0 Real Soon Now! :)
