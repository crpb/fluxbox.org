# Fluxbox Themes again

We decided to move <a href="/themes.php">themes</a> section - there is no need to double the location of the themes,
and it will speed things up.<br>
<b>Please submit all your beautiful themes at <a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/962/">Freshmeat.net</a> from now on.</b>
The themes which have been submitted already will stay here, but we don't accept new submissions anymore.
