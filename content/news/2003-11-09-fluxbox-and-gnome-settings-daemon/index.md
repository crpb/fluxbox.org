# Fluxbox and gnome-settings-daemon

<a href="mailto:torn&#64;autistici.org">Torn asks</a>: <i>I was reading the <a href="/docs/en/faq.php">fluxbox faq</a> and found what I was looking for:<br>
<b>Q</b>: Gtk2/Gnome2 applications look wired under Fluxbox, but they look ok
when gnome is started<br>
<b>A</b>: Run gnome-settings-daemon when Fluxbox starts, eg. put this into your
~/.xinitrc
<br><br>

Well, it works, but I'm using and enjoying fluxbox exactly because it
doesn't require tons of libraries and tools I just don't need. I want
just a bar and a menu, nothing less, nothing more.
<br><br>

I'm using debian, and installing gnome-control-center (which contains
the settings-daemon) requires me to install more then 30 other packages!
I was wondering if exists another tool like gnome-setting-daemon, or an
hack to simulate it, in order to get gtk2 apps look nice without
installing loads of unuseful things.
<br><br>

Thank you in advance, and keep on the good work, fluxbox rocks. </i>
