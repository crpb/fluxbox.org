# A xmas gi(f)t

The fluxbox team has decided to switch over to "git":http://git.or.cz/ 
for version control. You can surf the official repository at

p(). "http://git.fluxbox.org":http://git.fluxbox.org/

and can grab your own copy of the whole project by cloning it via

<pre>git clone git://git.fluxbox.org/fluxbox.git fluxbox.git</pre>

We hope to bring up a new version of the homepage soonish (planning first
month of the next year). Aside from all this "meta" stuff Mark did
an excellent job by hunting down lots of bugs while the rest of the crew
is a bit busy with real life jobs, so the team wants to send a big hug
over to Mark :)

For the rest of you: we wish you a good time with your family and a happy
new year.
