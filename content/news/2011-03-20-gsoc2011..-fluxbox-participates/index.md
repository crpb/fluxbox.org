# GSOC2011... fluxbox participates!


![GSOC Logo][lgsoc]

Your beloved and trusted windowmanager got accepted as a mentoring
organization on the [Google-Summer of Code][gsoc]. For those of you
living under a rock, I will briefly describe the general idea of
GSOC:

    You work fulltime on a fluxbox related project over the summer
    and get paid by Google. Yes, paid. Money.

At the moment we are working on filling out some related paper work
(eg, application templates), but you can have a look at some
[project ideas][fsoc] we have. You can read more about the next steps
for you and us at [Google's blog][bgsoc].

This is the first time we tried to become part of SOC and we are very
happy to see this happen.
