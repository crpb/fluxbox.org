# New goodies!

Thx to Han again, we have a bunch of new packages for Mandrake (also MandrakePPC), OpenBSD-port and rpm-snapshot-generator for RPM based distros.
You'd better check the <a href="/download.php">download</a> site yourselfs.<br>
I've made also a few updates in <a href="/docs.php">documentation</a> and added <a href="/docs/keys.php">List of valid keys actions</a> which you can assign to the shortcuts.<br>
Check also updated <a href="/docs/faq.php">FAQ</a>.
