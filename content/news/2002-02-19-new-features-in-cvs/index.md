# New features in CVS

Finally, our CVS version has stabilized again, it compiles, the annoying bug with the icons has been fixed and support for GNOME hints (still in development) has finally arrived!<br>
Maybe there is not much use of GNOME hints by now, but one feature you gonna love for sure
- xmms will start now sticky if you say so.
Just select in the <b>xmms menu:</b> <code>Options->Sticky</code> (or press Ctrl+S when xmms window is focused) and it will be remembered - next time you start xmms it will stick over your all desktops.<br>
You need to use <code>--enable-gnome</code> option during configure.<br>
Read on <a href="/download.php">download page</a>, how to get the CVS version.
