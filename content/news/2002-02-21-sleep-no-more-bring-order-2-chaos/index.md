# Sleep no more! Bring Order 2 Chaos

Got tired of dockapps poping up in random order on your slit?

Got tired of playing with sleep (<code>man 1 sleep</code>) for too long,
with miserable success?

Aren't you just pissed off?!

You are? Okie.. relax now, cause I have a *remedy* for you:

"xtoolwait":http://www.hacom.nl/~richard/software/xtoolwait-1.3.README is
the name of that wonderful tool, "download and bring order to chaos now!":http://www.hacom.nl/~richard/software/xtoolwait.html

Don't forget to
"RTFM":http://www.hacom.nl/~richard/software/xtoolwait-1.3.README first.
