# Fluxbox 1.3.4 - bend physics back to reality


New year, new release. Since the fluxbox-1.3.4 contained a few rather nasty
bugs (some have labeled it "unlucky release" :)), here is the 100% bug free
version you should use from now on. No more time holes, sorry folks.

General:

* Added 'LHalf' / 'RHalf' titlebar buttons
* Added 'ClientPatternTest' command for testing clientpatterns via
  fluxbox-remote
* Added 'he_IL' translations

Critical Bugfixes in 1.3.4:

* All timer based problems are fixed now
* Fixed integer overflows for some gradient textures
* Fixed compile issue on MacOS

Other Bugfixes:

* Correct renderinger of 'sunken' textures
* Move windows without the lagging-behind-effect on slower machines
* Improved color brightening in textures
* Memory and other code improvements in texture rendering code
* Fix build-system issues

Happy fluxboxing!
