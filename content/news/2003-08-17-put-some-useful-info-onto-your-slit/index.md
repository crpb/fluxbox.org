# Put some useful info onto your slit

I have a desktop machine (eternium) where I do some desktop stuff and a
server (genesis) where I do my usual server stuff...

The server has 2x350Mhz processors and this is kinda slow.. most of the
time I wait for compilcated, huge, bloated mysql queries to finish...

To solve it I have to come out with some faster/better alternatives of the
queries/php code, so I need to know what is the resources usage on my
server.

I used to ran top (to check the processor/system usage) in some terminal
window connected to the server but this wouldn't be so cool like having
such informations on fluxbox slit, right? ;)
