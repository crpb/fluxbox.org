# Remember the patch?

Xavier Brouckaert (xbr at info.ucl.ac.be) sends in info about his great <a href="http://bugfactory.org/~gav/fluxbox/">remember patch</a> (to remember and restore application settings like position, size, workspace, decorations, tab style). It works now with Fluxbox v0.13 and v0.14. <a href="http://bugfactory.org/~gav/fluxbox/">Get it and read instructions here</a>.
