# <A href="docs.php">Documentation</A>

Finally we have someone who will be dedicated to provide some good fluxbox documentation!<BR> The guy is <a href="mailto:stantoncook@ozemail.com.au">dyclops</A> and his first project will probably be a doc on "non-blackbox things" in fluxbox - thanks a lot for helping out.
