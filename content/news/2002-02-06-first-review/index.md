# First Review

<i> When I heard about Fluxbox , my first reaction was surprise. Having been a user of Blackbox for several years and many versions, I was a bit skeptical about Fluxbox's ability to extend a window manager that in my opinion, was already great. Nevertheless, after reading the list of enhancements to the desktop over Blackbox 0.61, I was excited to give it a try.</i><br>
Finally, we got some Press attention :)<br>
