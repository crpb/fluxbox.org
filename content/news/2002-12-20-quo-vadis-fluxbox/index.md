# Quo Vadis Fluxbox?

Ever wondered where is Fluxbox development going to? Good, cause Henrik just posted a message on our mailing list, about Fluxbox bright future.
<br><br>

<b>Fluxbox Next Generation Features:</b>
<ul>
<li>Layer support ("always on top") [high priority]
<br><br>

<li>Action system [high priority]<br>
    You will be able to specify actions for things like button click
    (thus overriding default actions)
<br><br>

<li>Transparent windows [low priority]<br>
    Configurable both compile time and runtime.
<br><br>

<li>RANDR support [low priority]<br>
    <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/~keithp/talks/randr/randr/">The X Resize and Rotate Extension</a>
<br><br>

<li>Tabs embedded in title bar. [high priority]<br>
    Instead of having them outside the window they will be inside the
    title bar, thus giving you even more desktop space.
</ul>

Except for these basic features there'll be some new unique features and
surprises.<br>

Due to these major changes in the code there will be a "beta" release
around the end of January and beginning of February, in which you can
bug test and evaluate it.
The release is sheduled at the end of February or beginning of March.
<br><br>

During this time, there might also be a bug fix release/patch for 0.1.14.
