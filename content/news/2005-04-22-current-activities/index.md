# Current Activities

No, we are not dead :) Behind the scenes we are hunting those ugly, nasty
little hobits ..... aeh ... BUGS and add some new features, eg there might
be "Type-Ahead":http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead/ for the menu
pretty soon. Another idea already tested by some brave folks from
\#fluxbox is the "CommandTool":http://darkshed.net/paste/shot-2005-03-17-144707-1024-768.jpg,
kind of fluxbox-commandline for the toolbar. Simon is currently busy with bringing fluxbox's hunger 
for memory down, still some issues to solve but it looks very promising so far.
Our little "fbot":http://core.fluxbox.org/~fbot/ has a new home: core.fluxbox.org, 
big thanx to 'car' who 'gave' us that box. I made some "WebButtons":http://darkshed.net/news/29/fluxbox-buttons-- 
you can freeely use to show the world that you are a fluxboxer :) 
And maybe there are some more things coming up, running secretly behind the scenes ... stay tuned!

Happy Fluxboxing :)
