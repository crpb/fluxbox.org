# Short and sweet and to the point: 1.3.2


Today the fluxbox team is very happy to announce a new release of fluxbox 1.3.2

After a very successful participation in GSOC2011 (we will report more soonish)
and right before we are starting our (slow turning, point taken) engines to 
integrate the result of the two GSOC2011 projects into the main line (which might
be a bit bumpy), we wanted something more stable for you.

Both Pavel and Gediminas, our GSOC2011 participants, contributed to this release
all over the place. Most notably, Gediminas added ARGB32 visuals to fluxbox (so, yes, your 
cairo-dock now looks awesome again). And Gediminas cleaned up some gory old code
mess and fixed some crashes along the road.

So, happy release and happy fluxboxing!
