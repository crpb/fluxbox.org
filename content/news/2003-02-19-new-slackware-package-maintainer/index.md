# New Slackware package maintainer

Since <a href="mailto:demerol@users.sourceforge.net">demerol</a> is no longer maintaining Slackware packages, we were looking for somebody who could replace him.<br>
New <a href="http://fluxbox.bottino.com">Slackware package</a> maintainer is <a href="mailto:greyhame@bottino.com">greyhame</a> from now on.<br>
Thanks demerol for his help on FluxBox and welcome grayhame to the FluxBox team.
