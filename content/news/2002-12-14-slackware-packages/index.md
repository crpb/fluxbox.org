# Slackware Packages

For those of you who are not on the fluxbox-users mail list, the fluxbox
slackware packages are "back online":http://www.demerol.org/.
Sorry about all the downtime, and the location will be changing so just go
to demerol.org for now and there will always be a way to the package.
