# fbstyle: Fluxbox Style Validator

This is very nice tool for all theme authors outhere.
"fbstyle":http://biz.dyndns.org/~jbisbee/fbstyle.cgi will check
your theme and tell you if something is wrong with it.  Right now I just
accept the text style file, but eventually it will take
a style tarball and will validate (checking the background image, and
pixmaps to make sure there aren't any missing files. Sounds great, right?

"Check it here":http://biz.dyndns.org/~jbisbee/fbstyle.cgi and don't forget to 
"report bugs to Jeff":mailto:fluxbox-users&#64;jbisbee.com.
