# New Tool For FluxBox

<a href="http://www.isomedia.com/homes/stevencooper/projects/fluxspace.html">Fluxspace</a> (by <a href="mailto:stevencooper&#64;isomedia.com">Steve Cooper</a>) is a tool which not only sets the background image, but can work with <a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/">Rox</a> or <a href="http://linuxhelp.hn.org/idesk.php">idesk</a> for per-workspace panels or desktop icons, and can start and stop slit or desktop applets in each workspace or globally.
It works well as a rootCommand for FluxBox.<br>
